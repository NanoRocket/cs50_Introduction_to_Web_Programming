                        I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

                        Fate is at your elbow; make yourself good while life and power are still yours

                        For the entire Earth is but a point, and the place of our habitation but a minute corner in it; and how many therein who will praise you, and what sort of men are they?

                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        Above all, never struggle or strain; but be a master of yourself, and view life as a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a mortal.
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        Do not copy the opinions of the arrogant, or let them dictate your own, but look at things in their true light.

                         From exertion come wisdom and purity; from sloth ignorance and sensuality. In the student sensuality is a sluggish habit of mind. An unclean person is universally a slothful one, one who sits by a stove, whom the sun shines on prostrate, who reposes without being fatigued. If you would avoid uncleannness, and all the sins, work earnestly, though it be at cleaning a stable.

                        Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other.
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be indefinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable.

                    <p>
                        A living dog is better than a dead lion. Shall a man go and hang himself because he belongs to the race of pygmies, and not be the biggest pygmy that he can? Let everyone mind his own business, and endeavor to be what he has made.

                        At this horror I sank nearly to the lichend earth, transfixed with a dread not of this nor any world, but only of the mad spaces between the stars

                    <p>
                        Great holes secretly are digged where earth's pores ought to suffice, and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        If we knew what we are we should do as Sir Arthur Jermyn did, and Arthur Jermyn soaked himself in oil and set fire to his clothing one night
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        You and I have drifted to the worlds that reel about the red Arcturus, and dwelt in the bodies of the insect philosophers that crawl proudly over the fourth moon of Jupiter.
